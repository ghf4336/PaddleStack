# Quick Visual Testing Guide

Your app is now running at: **http://localhost:5174/PaddleStack/**

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Desktop View (Current)
Open the app and verify:
- ‚úÖ Welcome page is centered and looks good
- ‚úÖ "Start Session Manually" button works
- ‚úÖ After starting, you see sidebar + Next Up + Courts sections side by side

### 2. Add Some Test Data
Click "Start Session Manually", then:

- Verify courts auto-populate with players

### 3. Test Responsiveness
**Method A: Browser DevTools**
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+M` to toggle device toolbar
3. Try these sizes:
   - iPhone SE (375px) - Should see single column
   - iPad (768px) - Should see single column with better spacing
   - Desktop (1440px) - Should see multi-column layout

**Method B: Resize Window**
- Grab the edge of your browser window
- Slowly make it narrower
- Watch how the layout automatically reorganizes:
  - **Wide**: Sidebar | Next Up | Courts (3 columns)
  - **Medium**: Everything stacks vertically
  - **Narrow**: Single column, compact spacing
